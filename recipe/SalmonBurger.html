        <p>Basically it`s really testy and healthy burger made of salmon</p>
        <h3>What do u need to coock it? uuhhh</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless, skinless salmon fillets, about 550g/1lb 4oz in total, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Thai red curry paste</li>
            <li>thumb-size piece fresh root ginger, grated</li>
            <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 bunch coriander, half chopped, half leaves picked</li>
            <li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2-3 mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>lemon wedges, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>So how do we coock it</h4>
        <ul>
            <li style="width: 300px;">
                <h4>step 1</h5>
                <p>Tip the salmon into a food processor with the paste, ginger, soy and chopped
                     coriander. Pulse until roughly minced. Tip out the mix and shape into 4 burgers.
                      Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan, then fry the burgers for 4-5 mins on each 
                      side, turning until crisp and cooked through.</p>
            </li>
            <li style="width: 300px;">
                <h4>step 2</h5>
                <p>Meanwhile, use a swivel peeler to peel strips of carrot and cucumber into a bowl. Toss with 
                    the vinegar and sugar until the sugar has dissolved, then toss through the coriander leaves. 
                    Divide the salad between 4 plates. Serve with the burgers and rice.</p>
